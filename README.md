# MovieRecommendationAlgorithmsProject
This project is done in Spring 2023 as the final group project for a data mining course. In this project, we built Movie Recommender Systems using the KNN algorithm from the scikit-learn library, the SVD algorithm from the surprise library, and the Apriori algorithm from the mlxtend library.
